## 2.3.1 Classical statistics for classical data

Proof that the mean of the Poisson distribution maximises the log-likelihood:
From before we know that the liklihood (written here as L) is a multiplication
of all the inidividual probabilities:

\[L(\lambda,x = (k_{1},k_{2},k_{3}...)) = \prod_{i=1}^{100} f(k_{i}) \]

f(k) is simply the Poisson density function:

\[f(k)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!}\]

So if we put those together and take the log of both sides, we get:

\[\log(L(\lambda,x)) =
\log(\prod_{i=1}^{100}\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!})\]

We know that the product log of a product ($\prod_{}^{}$) is the same as the sum
($\sum_{}^{}$) of a log, we can rewrite it as:

\[ \log L= \sum_{i=1}^{100}\log(\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!})\]

We can also break up the fraction, again using the log rules of
$\log(a*b)=log(a)+log(b)$ and $\log(\frac{a}{b})=\log(a)-log(b)$:

\[\log L= \sum_{i=1}^{100}(\log(e^{-\lambda}) + \log(\lambda^{k}) -\log({k!}))\]

Now we can get rid of the powers using $\log(a^{b})=b\log(a)$. Also $\log(e)=1$
because this is the natural log.

\[\log L= \sum_{i=1}^{100}(-\lambda + k\log(\lambda) - \log({k!}))\]

Now we want to break apart the sum by extracting terms that do not depend on
k.The final term does not depend on lambda, so it is just a constant:

\[log L= -100\lambda+\log\lambda(\sum_{i=1}^{100}k_{i}) + const.\]

To get the maximum of a function we want the derivative of the function to be
equal to 0:

\[\frac{d}{d\lambda}\log L=
\frac{d}{d\lambda}(-100\lambda+\log\lambda(\sum_{i=1}^{100}k_{i}) + const.) =
0\]

Using the derivative rules of $\frac{d}{dx}ax=a$ and
$\frac{d}{dx}\log(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, and derivative of a constant is 0, we get:

\[-100 + \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{i=1}^{100}k_{i} = 0\] \[100 =
\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{i=1}^{100}k_{i}\]

Multiply by $\frac{\lambda}{100}$:

\[\lambda=\frac{1}{100}\sum_{i=1}^{100}k_{i} = \overline{k}\] 

So the $\lambda$ paramter is the same as the mean ($\overline{k}$).

## Likelihood for the binomial distribution 

\[f(\theta \mid n,y) = f(y
\mid n,\theta) = \binom{n}{y}\theta^{y}(1-\theta)^{(n-y)}\]

To avoid large-number multiplications we take the log of both sides (log
likelihood): 

\[\log f(\theta \mid n,y) = \log
(\binom{n}{y}\theta^{y}(1-\theta)^{(n-y)})\]

We break up the product using the log rule $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$:

\[\log f(\theta \mid n,y) = \log\binom{n}{y}+
\log\theta^{y}+\log(1-\theta)^{(n-y)})\]

We bring down the exponents using the $\log(a^{b})=b\log(a)$ rule:

\[\log f(\theta \mid n,y) = \log\binom{n}{y}+ y\log\theta+(n-y)\log(1-\theta)\]

This is the formula used in the text.

## Hardy Weinberg equilibrium

We have two alleles in a population, N and M. Frequency of M is p Frequency of N
is 1-p, which we will call q.

Since both copies of an allele are distributed independantly, the freuency or
probability of the different combinations of two alleles are:

\[P_{MM}=p \times p=p^2, P_{NN}=q\times q=q^2, P_{MN}=p \times q + q \times p=2pq \]

As data we normally observe the counts of the different genotypes
$(n_{MM},n_{NN}, n_{MN})$ and the total number of individuals
$S=n_{MM}+n_{NN}+n_{MN}$

Using the mutinomial formula we can write the likelihood of the data given the
expected porbabilities of $p^2,q^2,2pq$:

\[P(n_{MM},n_{MN},n_{NN} \mid
p) = \binom{S}{n_{MM},n_{MN},n_{NN}} (p^2)^{n_{MM}} \times (2pq)^{n_{NM}} \times (q^2)^{n_{NN}}\]

To get the log likelihood we take the log of both sides:

\[L(p) = \log(\binom{S}{n_{MM},n_{MN},n_{NN}}(p^2)^{n_{MM}} \times (2pq)^{n_{NM}} \times (q^2)^{n_{NN}})\]

Separating the terms with $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$ rule:

\[L(p) = \log(\binom{S}{n_{MM},n_{MN},n_{NN}}) + \log((p^2)^{n_{MM}}) + \log((2pq)^{n_{NM}}) + \log((q^2)^{n_{NN}})\]

We bring forward the exponants with $\log(a^b)=b\log(a)$ rule:

\[L(p) = \log(\binom{S}{n_{MM},n_{MN},n_{NN}}) + 2n_{MM}\log(p) + n_{NM} \log(2pq) + 2n_{NN} \log(q)\]

To maximise the log likelihood we must take the derivative and set it to 0:

\[0 = \frac{d}{dp}\log(\binom{S}{n_{MM},n_{MN},n_{NN}}) + \frac{d}{dp}2n_{MM}\log(p) + \frac{d}{dp}n_{NM} \log(2pq) + \frac{d}{dp}2n_{NN}\log(q)\]

The first term does not depend on p, so the derivative is 0, and we can 
substitute back in $q=1-p$:

\[0 = 0 + \frac{d}{dp}2n_{MM}\log(p) + \frac{d}{dp}n_{NM} \log(2p(1-p)) + \frac{d}{dp}2n_{NN}\log(1-p)\]
